#Javascript 30 day 06

This project was a fun refresher for data fetching and using vanilla javascript to dynamically change content on the page. I did each step of the project first, then went back to watch what Wes decided to do to make sure I wasn't missing something that would cause things to fail later in the code. Overall, this was a pretty easy project as far as the knowledge needed for getting to the end.
